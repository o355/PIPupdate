## Why did you move to GitLab?
I do not want to support GitHub after Microsoft acquired GitHub. I do not support publishing my work on a website owned by an extremely anti-user, pro-proprietary and pro-surveillance company.

## Why delete your code?
I do not want my code published on this site anymore.
